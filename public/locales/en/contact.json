  "faq_q2": "Is there a screening process for participants?",
  "faq_a2": "Yes, we conduct thorough background checks for all participants to ensure safety and compatibility. This includes verification of identity, references, and sometimes criminal background checks.",
  "faq_q3": "How are matches made between students and seniors?",
  "faq_a3": "We use a careful matching process that considers lifestyle preferences, location, interests, and living requirements. Both parties are introduced to each other before making any commitments, and must mutually agree to the arrangement.",
